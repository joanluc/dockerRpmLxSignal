Portage of Signal App with docker for RPM based Linux

* Install Signal on Linux
  Unfortunaly Signal is only available in Linux in the DEB format so it can't be used in RPM based distribution, i found a flatpak installation process at https://www.howtogeek.com/709784/how-to-install-signal-desktop-on-linux/ and tryed it in  my Fedora box but it ended on an error.
  
  It why i decided to try to use docker to install and run Signal in my Fedora box.

* Install Signal in Fedora or over RPM based Linux
